# Personal Health Tracker

- This web application allows users to track metrics about their health privately. Many apps and website currently exist to track a users health but they typically store and sell their user's data to third parties. This web app will encrypt all user data and provide useful user interfaces to record and visualize a user's physical health journey.
- The web app will use React/React Native for UI, Express for API, and MongoDB NoSQL as storage.
- I intend for the app to work on mobile Android/Apple devices as well as desktop.
